# Phonebook System

## Overview
This is a simple Phonebook System that allows an admin to manage contacts stored in a PostgreSQL database. The system consists of two separate projects:
- **API Project**: Developed using .NET Core, applying the Onion Architecture.
- **Web Project**: Built with Angular 16, featuring a minimal yet functional UI.

## Features
- **Add Contact**: Admin can add new contacts.
- **Remove Contact**: Admin can delete existing contacts.
- **Edit Contact**: Admin can update contact details.
- **Search Contact**: Search by any part of the name, phone number, or email.
- **List Contacts**: Display all saved contacts from the database.
